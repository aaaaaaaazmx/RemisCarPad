ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* button_bg-web.png
* call_bg-web.png
* ic_launcher-web.png
* key
* proguard-project.txt
* refresh_bg-web.png
* set_bg-web.png

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\src\main\assets
* libs\ksoap2-android-assembly-3.0.0-RC.4-jar-with-dependencies.jar => app\libs\ksoap2-android-assembly-3.0.0-RC.4-jar-with-dependencies.jar
* libs\okhttp-3.12.1.jar => app\libs\okhttp-3.12.1.jar
* libs\okhttp-android-support-3.12.1.jar => app\libs\okhttp-android-support-3.12.1.jar
* libs\okio-1.5.0.jar => app\libs\okio-1.5.0.jar
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
